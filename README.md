# Healthcare Data Cleaning & Analysis Project 

This project focused on a common, yet critical, challenge in data science: cleaning and preparing a messy dataset for analysis. The dataset, related to healthcare, presented numerous inconsistencies requiring careful attention.  These issues ranged from formatting problems (mixed-case names, inconsistent capitalization, incorrect date formats) to data quality concerns (duplicate IDs, missing values, negative salaries, non-numeric credit scores).  My work involved developing and implementing a robust cleaning process to address these challenges systematically.

The cleaning process encompassed several key steps.  Normalization techniques were applied to textual data, ensuring consistency in names and city names.  Missing values in key demographic fields (age, blood type, education) were handled using appropriate imputation strategies.  Logical inconsistencies, such as negative salaries, were corrected.  Data type conversions were performed to ensure numerical fields, including credit scores, were represented accurately.  Duplicate records were identified and removed based on unique identifiers.  Missing values in the health condition field were addressed on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific context.  Finally, categorical variables were prepared for analysis using one-hot encoding, and numerical columns were normalized to a consistent scale.

Following the data cleaning phase, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain initial insights.  Visualizations, created using Seaborn and Matplotlib, explored the distributions of key variables such as salary and age.  The relationship between credit score and salary was also examined using scatter plots.  A bar chart summarized the prevalence of different health conditions within the dataset.

The project extended beyond data cleaning and EDA to include more advanced analytical techniques.  Outlier detection methods were employed to identify and understand extreme values.  Correlation analysis explored the relationships between variables.  Furthermore, I developed predictive models, including one for salary prediction and another for health condition classification.  Finally, clustering analysis was used to identify potential groupings or segments within the data.  This project demonstrates a systematic approach to data cleaning and analysis, moving from initial data preparation to insightful exploration and predictive modeling.
